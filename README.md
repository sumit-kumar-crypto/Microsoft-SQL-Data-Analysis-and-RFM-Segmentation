# Microsoft SQL Data Analysis and RFM Segmentation


Conducted an in-depth data analysis project utilizing Microsoft SQL to extract valuable insights and performed Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) segmentation. Leveraged Tableau for effective visualization of findings and actionable recommendations.

**Performed analysis in MS SQL is following:**


_---DATA OVERLOOK:_

select * from sales_data_sample

_---UNIQUE VALUE CHECK:_

select distinct status from sales_data_sample
select distinct year_id from sales_data_sample
select distinct COUNTRY from sales_data_sample
select distinct TERRITORY from sales_data_sample
select distinct DEALSIZE from sales_data_sample
select distinct PRODUCTLINE from sales_data_sample

_---DATA ANALYSIS_


_---Year Wise Production:_

select YEAR_ID,SUM(sales) as REVENUE
from sales_data_sample
group by YEAR_ID
ORDER BY 2 DESC

_---Grouping Sales by PRODUCTLINE:_

select PRODUCTLINE,SUM(sales) as REVENUE
from sales_data_sample
group by PRODUCTLINE
ORDER BY 2 DESC

_---Examining the number of months Sales was active in different years:_

select YEAR_ID,count(distinct(MONTH_ID)) FROM sales_data_sample
group by YEAR_ID



_---Months with highest number of REVENUE generated:_

select YEAR_ID,MONTH_ID,SUM(sales) as REVENUE,COUNT(ORDERNUMBER) AS FREQUENCY
from sales_data_sample
group by YEAR_ID,MONTH_ID
ORDER BY 3 DESC


_---Highest Revenue being generated in November and October,Let's examine the PRODUCTLINE of those months:_

select YEAR_ID,MONTH_ID,PRODUCTLINE,SUM(sales) as REVENUE,COUNT(ORDERNUMBER) AS FREQUENCY
from sales_data_sample
group by YEAR_ID,MONTH_ID,PRODUCTLINE
ORDER BY 4 DESC




_---DEALSIZE proportion according to REVENUE generated:_

select DEALSIZE,SUM(sales) as REVENUE
from sales_data_sample
group by DEALSIZE
ORDER BY 2 DESC


_---Finding out the best customer with RFM Analysis:_
